              "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It provides fast average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval. Collisions, which occur when two different keys hash to the same index, are typically handled by methods like 'Separate Chaining' (each bucket contains a linked list of entries) or 'Open Addressing' (probing for the next empty slot).",
              "It's an array-based structure where a hash function computes an index for a key, where the value is stored. When a collision happens, Separate Chaining uses a list or another data structure at the collision index, while Open Addressing finds another empty spot in the same array, for example, by linear probing."

Read-through is similar, but the cache library itself handles loading from the database. Write-through writes data to the cache and the database simultaneously, ensuring consistency but with higher latency."

It only updates component observers that are in an active lifecycle state. Together, they form a robust pattern for UI development where the UI observes data in the ViewModel, which is exposed via LiveData."
